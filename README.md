# Are Ensembles Getting Better all the Time?
This repository replicates the experiments of Mattei & Garreau (2024).

The notebook wisdom_crowds_rotten_tomatoes replicates and extends the results on using crowds to predict the ratings of future movies, based on data collected by Simoiu et al. (2019) available [here](https://github.com/stanford-policylab/wisdom-of-crowds).
